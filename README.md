# Cross-Lingual Cross-Age Group Adaptation for Low-Resource Elderly Speech Emotion Recognition
In this work, we study the prospect of transferring emotion recognition ability over various age groups and languages through the utilization of multilingual pre-trained speech models. In this work, we develop two speech emotion recognition resources, i.e., BiMotion and YueMotion. 
- **BiMotion** is a bi-lingual bi-age-group speech emotion recognition benchmark that covers 6 adult and elderly speech emotion recognition datasets from English and Mandarin Chinese.
- **YueMotion** is a newly-constructed publicly-available Cantonese speech emotion recognition dataset.
